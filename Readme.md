# Shivver (WIP)

The Reflective Lambda Machine with Cold Storage

Shivver is a minimal Scheme-like language intended for reflective bootstrapping
of higher level languages. Shivver is an evolution of the older
[Shimmer](https://github.com/discus-lang/shimmer) language.

The implementation is plain, portable C99 code.

This project is just getting started, so not much works yet.
